### How to exercise efficiently.   

I started to feel the importance of exercise. Unlike my childhood, I cannot do some yoga position, have pain on neck and shoulder, and sometimes feel muscle is weaker. But I do not really enjoy exercise and do not know how. Is there good way to do?

Exercise by body part helps efficiency and rest. Keeping exercise in un-recovered condition may occur overtraining syndrome such as fatigue, depression, insomnia. Dr. Isratel, an exercise specialist, said 20 sets by body apart per week is good. Based on the researches, 6-12 times per set and 3 times per week for fast recovery body part and twice per week for slower recovery body part are proper.

Feedbeck : This quesiton is too general. Try little more in detail such as what exercise helps for insomnia or back pain.

### Gratitude and Happiness

People say if I am more grateful, I become happier. When I was highschool 2nd grade, I wrote 5 daily grateful things, but I did not feel the difference. 
But it difinately make listener feel better, and this small compliment would back to me. 

According to Havard Health Publishing(https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier), the author said 'gratitude is an attainment associated with emotional maturity' and gratitude helps deal with hardship. 

Feedbeck : This one is better that I can collect data measuring happiness and gratitude.
